  This is a page for me to display my fitness progress, a critical aspect in life that I've been missing. I've been morbidly obese since childhood, but decided that 
  I needed to focus on myself far more after graduation. Since then I've lost around 15lbs in those 6 months. I am not happy about that progress, and I think that exercise is a major
  area of weakness. I'd crafted this ketogenic diet, but found that my exercise quality and frequency were lacking significantly, with long recovery times and starting in the morning
  causing me to loose the will power to go for morning jogs. I'm changing that diet a little bit, putting more emphasis on paleo ingredients and less on ketogenics. This still means I can't eat rice, pasta,
  or bread but now I'll eat more fruit and some veggies with a less emphasis on getting carbs below 10%.

  This will also be a page for me to get started with d3.js for displaying data, goals, and experimenting on what works for me.
